        "- **You can undo anything:** Git provides a *complete history* of every change that has ever been made to your project, timestamped, commented, and attributed. If something breaks, you always have the choice of going back to a previous state.  This is INCREDIBLY useful when you are working on a complex data science project.  This means no more saving files as `my_homework_final.ipynb`, `my_homework_final_final.ipynb`, `my_homework_final_final_REALLY_final.ipynb`, and so on. \n",
        "- **You won't *need* to keep undo-ing things:** One of the advantages of using git properly is that by keeping new changes separate from a stable base, you tend to avoid the massive rollbacks associated with constantly tinkering with a single code.\n",
        "- **You can identify exactly when and where changes were made:** Git allows you to pinpoint when a particular piece of code was changed, so finding what other pieces of code a bug might affect or figuring out why a certain expression was added is easy.\n",

If you think about what version control is, this might not be surprising: in order to remember every change that's ever been made, you need to store a record of those changes *somewhere*, and to be able to handle multiple people changing the same code, you need to have different copies of the project and a way to combine them.\n",

        " - The **working directory** is what you're currently looking at on your local machine. When you use an editor to modify a file, the changes are made to the working directory.\n",
        " - The **staging area** is a place to collect a set of changes made to your project. If you have changed three files to fix a bug, you will add all three to the staging area so that you can remember the changes as one historical entity. It is also called the **index**. You move files from the working directory to the index using the command `git add`.\n",
        " - The **local repository** is the place where git stores everything you've ever done to your project. Even when you delete a file, a copy is stored in the repo (this is necessary for always being able to undo any change). It's important to note that a local repository doesn't look much at all like your project files or directories. Git has its own way of storing all the information, and if you're curious what it looks like, look in the `.git` directory in the working directory of your project. Files are moved from the index to the local repository via the command `git commit`.\n",
        " - When working in a team, every member will be working on their own local repository. An **upstream repository** allows everyone to agree on a single version of history. If two people have made changes on their local repositories, they will combine those changes in the upstream repository (in our case that is GitHub).  This upstream repository is also called a **remote** in git parlance. The standard github remote is called the **origin**: it is the repository which is given a web page on github. One usually moves code from local to remote repositories using `git push`, and in the other direction using `git pull` .\n",
